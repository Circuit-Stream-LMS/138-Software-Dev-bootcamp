# Lab 3: Backend API Exercise

## Overview

This lab is a full technical exercise designed to give you a thorough practice of Unit 3 Backend Development skills. Build a REST API using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose. The lab is expected

## Goal

Create an API for a small content management system for an online study group portal. The portal stores information about study sessions, student notes, and optional resources. Your API should allow clients to perform CRUD operations, search for sessions, and manage related notes.

## What to build

You will create a backend service with the following responsibilities:

- Define Mongoose models for `Session`, `Note`, and `Resource`
- Build Express routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting sessions
- Add nested routes for notes attached to a session
  - A nested route means the note routes include the parent session ID in the path, for example `/sessions/:sessionId/notes`
- Add support for searching and filtering session data
- Implement validation, error handling, and basic request logging
- Research and implement one advanced Mongoose or API pattern not shown in the main lessons

## Requirements

### 1. Project setup

- Initialize a new Node.js project with `npm init -y`
- Install required dependencies: `express`, `mongoose`, `dotenv`, and any other helpers you choose
- Create an entrypoint file such as `server.js` or `app.js`
- Use `.env` to store database URI and port settings

### 2. MongoDB schema design

Create these schemas:

#### `Session`

- `title` (string, required)
- `date` (Date, required)
- `topic` (string, required)
- `duration` (number, minutes)
- `level` (string, one of `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`)
- `createdAt` (Date, default now)

Example: in a Mongoose schema you can define `level` like this:

```js
level: {
  type: String,
  enum: ['beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced'],
  required: true,
}
```

- `enum` means the field can only have one of the listed values.
- It helps keep data clean by rejecting anything outside the allowed list.
- In this example, `level` must be `beginner`, `intermediate`, or `advanced`.

#### `Note`

- `sessionId` (ObjectId, required, links to `Session`)
- `author` (string, required)
- `text` (string, required)
- `type` (string, one of `tip`, `question`, `summary`)
- `createdAt` (Date, default now)

#### `Resource`

- `name` (string, required)
- `url` (string, required)
- `category` (string, e.g. `article`, `video`, `tool`)
- `createdAt` (Date, default now)

### 3. API routes

Build the following routes using Express:

#### Sessions

- `GET /sessions` — return all sessions
- `GET /sessions/:id` — return one session by id
- `POST /sessions` — create a new session
- `PUT /sessions/:id` — update a session
- `DELETE /sessions/:id` — delete a session

#### Notes

- `GET /sessions/:sessionId/notes` — list notes for a session
- `POST /sessions/:sessionId/notes` — add a new note to a session
- `DELETE /sessions/:sessionId/notes/:noteId` — delete a note

#### Resources

- `GET /resources` — list all resources
- `POST /resources` — add a resource
- `GET /resources?category=video` — filter resources by category

### 4. Search and filtering

Add at least one query feature:

- Search sessions by `topic` or `title` using query string parameters
- Filter sessions by `level`

Example: `/sessions?search=security&level=advanced`

### 5. Validation and error handling

- Validate request payloads before saving to MongoDB
- Return meaningful HTTP status codes: `400`, `404`, `500`, etc.
- Report validation errors from Mongoose in the response body

### 6. Extra Challenge

- Enable CORS so a frontend can call the API. Search for `express cors` and the `cors` package.
- Add a `GET /sessions/stats` endpoint that returns summary statistics such as total sessions, average duration, and sessions per level. Search for `mongoose aggregate`.
- Implement `GET /sessions/:id/summary` that returns a simple summary object for the session, such as the session title and notes count.
- Add a `DELETE /resources/:id` route so resources can be removed cleanly.

### 7. Example behavior

Example request and response flows:

#### Create a session

Request:

```
POST /sessions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "API Design Lab",
  "date": "2026-05-20",
  "topic": "Node.js REST APIs",
  "duration": 110,
  "level": "intermediate"
}
```

Response:

```
201 Created
{
  "_id": "642d4f9f4c3f8b6a2e9e7b2c",
  "title": "API Design Lab",
  "date": "2026-05-20T00:00:00.000Z",
  "topic": "Node.js REST APIs",
  "duration": 110,
  "level": "intermediate"
}
```

#### Search sessions

Request:

```
GET /sessions?search=APIs&level=intermediate
```

Response:

```
200 OK
[
  {
    "_id": "642d4f9f4c3f8b6a2e9e7b2c",
    "title": "API Design Lab",
    "topic": "Node.js REST APIs",
    "level": "intermediate"
  }
]
```

#### Get session notes

Request:

```
GET /sessions/642d4f9f4c3f8b6a2e9e7b2c/notes
```

Response:

```
200 OK
[
  {
    "_id": "643b6a33c5f4d1d28a002c71",
    "author": "Amina",
    "text": "Remember to validate request data before saving.",
    "type": "tip"
  }
]
```

## Notes

- You do not need to build a frontend for this lab.
- Focus on clear API design, maintainable code, and good error responses.
- Write code as if this API will be used by a frontend app
